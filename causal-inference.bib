	abstract = {We revisit the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading oﬀ regularization bias with overﬁtting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overﬁtting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N −1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overﬁtting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0, and (2) making use of cross-ﬁtting which provides an eﬃcient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N −1/2-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid conﬁdence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coeﬃcient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment eﬀect and the average treatment eﬀect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average treatment eﬀect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.},

	abstract = {The term “interference” has been used to describe any setting in which one subject’s exposure may affect another subject’s outcome. We use causal diagrams to distinguish among three causal mechanisms that give rise to interference. The ﬁrst causal mechanism by which interference can operate is a direct causal effect of one individual’s treatment on another individual’s outcome; we call this direct interference. Interference by contagion is present when one individual’s outcome may affect the outcomes of other individuals with whom he comes into contact. Then giving treatment to the ﬁrst individual could have an indirect effect on others through the treated individual’s outcome. The third pathway by which interference may operate is allocational interference. Treatment in this case allocates individuals to groups; through interactions within a group, individuals may affect one another’s outcomes in any number of ways. In many settings, more than one type of interference will be present simultaneously. The causal effects of interest differ according to which types of interference are present, as do the conditions under which causal effects are identiﬁable. Using causal diagrams for interference, we describe these differences, give criteria for the identiﬁcation of important causal effects, and discuss applications to infectious diseases.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04692},
	abstract = {Peer effects, in which the behavior of an individual is affected by the behavior of their peers, are posited by multiple theories in the social sciences. Other processes can also produce behaviors that are correlated in networks and groups, thereby generating debate about the credibility of observational (i.e. nonexperimental) studies of peer effects. Randomized ﬁeld experiments that identify peer effects, however, are often expensive or infeasible. Thus, many studies of peer effects use observational data, and prior evaluations of causal inference methods for adjusting observational data to estimate peer effects have lacked an experimental “gold standard” for comparison. Here we show, in the context of information and media diffusion on Facebook, that high-dimensional adjustment of a nonexperimental control group (677 million observations) using propensity score models produces estimates of peer effects statistically indistinguishable from those from using a large randomized experiment (220 million observations). Naive observational estimators overstate peer effects by 320\% and commonly used variables (e.g., demographics) offer little bias reduction, but adjusting for a measure of prior behaviors closely related to the focal behavior reduces bias by 91\%. High-dimensional models adjusting for over 3,700 past behaviors provide additional bias reduction, such that the full model reduces bias by over 97\%. This experimental evaluation demonstrates that detailed records of individuals’ past behavior can improve studies of social inﬂuence, information diffusion, and imitation; these results are encouraging for the credibility of some studies but also cautionary for studies of rare or new behaviors. More generally, these results show how large, high-dimensional data sets and statistical learning techniques can be used to improve causal inference in the behavioral sciences.},

Instead of using samples from the target distribution to reactively correct dataset shift, we use graphical knowledge of the causal mechanisms relating variables in a prediction problem to proactively remove relationships that do not generalize across environments, even when these relationships may depend on unobserved variables (violations of the “no unobserved confounders” assumption). To accomplish this, we identify variables with unstable paths of statistical inﬂuence and remove them from the model. We also augment the causal graph with latent counterfactual variables that isolate unstable paths of statistical inﬂuence, allowing us to retain stable paths that would otherwise be removed. Our experiments demonstrate that models that remove vulnerable variables and use estimates of the latent variables transfer better, often outperforming in the target domain despite some accuracy loss in the training domain.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11038},
	abstract = {In most real-world systems units are interconnected and can be represented as networks consisting of nodes and edges. For instance, in social systems individuals can have social ties, family or ﬁnancial relationships. In settings where some units are exposed to a treatment and its eﬀect spills over connected units, estimating both the direct eﬀect of the treatment and spillover eﬀects presents several challenges. First, assumptions on the way and the extent to which spillover eﬀects occur along the observed network are required. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment is not under the control of the investigator, confounding and homophily are potential threats to the identiﬁcation and estimation of causal eﬀects on networks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: i) neighborhood interference, which assumes interference operates only through a function of the immediate neighbors’ treatments ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and neighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding variables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we develop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for treatment and spillover eﬀects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under diﬀerent levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors’ treatment. Adjustment for propensity score is performed using a penalized spline regression. Inference capitalizes on a three-step Bayesian procedure which allows to take into account the uncertainty in the propensity score estimation and avoiding model feedback. Finally, correlation of interacting units is taken into account using a community detection algorithm and incorporating random eﬀects in the outcome model. All these sources of variability, including variability of treatment assignment, are accounted for in the posterior distribution of ﬁnite-sample causal estimands. We conducted a simulation study where we assess the performance of our estimator on diﬀerent type of networks, generated from a stochastic block model and a latent space model or given from the friendship-network of the Add-Health study.},

	abstract = {Social inﬂuence cannot be identiﬁed from purely observational data on social networks, because such inﬂuence is generically confounded with latent homophily, i.e., with a node’s network partners being informative about the node’s attributes and therefore its behavior. We show that if the network grows according to either a latent community (stochastic block) model, or a continuous latent space model, then latent homophilous attributes can be consistently estimated from the global pattern of social ties. Moreover, these estimates are informative enough that controlling for them allows for unbiased and consistent estimation of social-inﬂuence eﬀects in additive models. In addition, we provide bounds on the potential bias in estimates of social-inﬂuence for ﬁnite samples. These are the ﬁrst results on the consistent estimation of social-inﬂuence eﬀects in the presence of latent homophily, and we discuss the prospects for generalizing them.},

One approach is to model the relationships between the covariates and the outcome and use those relationships to predict the missing values. Another is to model the probabilities of missingness given the covariates and incorporate them into a weighted or stratiﬁed estimate. Doubly robust (DR) procedures apply both types of model simultaneously and produce a consistent estimate of the parameter if either of the two models has been correctly speciﬁed. In this article, we show that DR estimates can be constructed in many ways. We compare the performance of various DR and non-DR estimates of a population mean in a simulated example where both models are incorrect but neither is grossly misspeciﬁed. Methods that use inverse-probabilities as weights, whether they are DR or not, are sensitive to misspeciﬁcation of the propensity model when some estimated propensities are small. Many DR methods perform better than simple inverse-probability weighting. None of the DR methods we tried, however, improved upon the performance of simple regression-based prediction of the missing values. This study does not represent every missing-data problem that will arise in practice. But it does demonstrate that, in at least some settings, two wrong models are not better than one.},

DAGs describe the relationship between measurements taken at various discrete times including the effect of interventions. The causal mechanisms, on the other hand, would naturally be assumed to be a continuous process operating over time in a cause–effect fashion. How does such immediate causation, that is causation occurring over very short time intervals, relate to DAGs constructed from discrete observations? We introduce a time-continuous model and simulate discrete observations in order to judge the relationship between the DAG and the immediate causal model. We find that there is no clear relationship; indeed the Bayesian network described by the DAG may not relate to the causal model. Typically, discrete observations of a process will obscure the conditional dependencies that are represented in the underlying mechanistic model of the process. It is therefore doubtful whether DAGs are always suited to describe causal relationships unless time is explicitly considered in the model. We relate the issues to mechanistic modeling by using the concept of local (in)dependence. An example using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study is presented.},

This framework makes it possible to link descriptive and explicative statistical models, and encompasses quantitative processes and events. One of the features of the paper is the clear distinction between the model for the system and the model for the observation. We give a dynamical representation of a conventional joint model for human immunodeficiency virus load and CD4 cell counts. We show its inadequacy to capture causal influences whereas in contrast known mechanisms of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus can be expressed directly through a system of differential equations.},

	abstract = {Methods for inferring average causal eﬀects have traditionally relied on two key assumptions: (i) the intervention received by one unit cannot causally inﬂuence the outcome of another; and (ii) units can be organized into non-overlapping groups such that outcomes of units in separate groups are independent. In this paper, we develop new statistical methods for causal inference based on a single realization of a network of connected units for which neither assumption (i) nor (ii) holds. The proposed approach allows both for arbitrary forms of interference, whereby the outcome of a unit may depend on interventions received by other units with whom a network path through connected units exists; and long range dependence, whereby outcomes for any two units likewise connected by a path in the network may be dependent. Under network versions of consistency and no unobserved confounding, inference is made tractable by an assumption that the networks outcome, treatment and covariate vectors are a single realization of a certain chain graph model. This assumption allows inferences about various network causal eﬀects via the auto-g-computation algorithm, a network generalization of Robins’ well-known g-computation algorithm previously described for causal inference under assumptions (i) and (ii).},

The method is then generalized to observational studies where treatments were not randomly assigned, so that sensitivity to hidden biases must be examined. Adjustments using an instrumental variable are also discussed. The methods are illustrated using data from two observational studies.},

Such methods make various assumptions on the data generating process to facilitate its identiﬁcation from purely observational data. Continuing this line of research, we show how to discover the complete causal structure of continuous-valued data, under the assumptions that (a) the data generating process is linear, (b) there are no unobserved confounders, and (c) disturbance variables have non-gaussian distributions of non-zero variances. The solution relies on the use of the statistical method known as independent component analysis (ICA), and does not require any pre-speciﬁed time-ordering of the variables. We provide a complete Matlab package for performing this LiNGAM analysis (short for Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model), and demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the method using artiﬁcially generated data.},

	abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave empioyment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject’s assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data tile. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated.},

We propose a new class of inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators that are consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN) for estimating β0 when the non-response probabilities can be parametrically modelled and a CAN estimator exists. The proposed estimators do not require full specification of the likelihood and their computation does not require numerical integration. We show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semi-parametric variance bound for the model. In some models, no CAN estimator of β0 exists. We provide a general algorithm for determining when CAN estimators of β0 exist. Our results follow after specializing a general representation described in the article for the efficient score and the influence function of regular, asymptotically linear estimators in an arbitrary semi-parametric model with non-ignorable non-response in which the probability of observing complete data is bounded away from zero and the non-response probabilities can be parametrically modelled. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
