	abstract = {The conditions under which ordinary least squares (OLS) is an unbiased and consistent estimator of the linear probability model (LPM) are unlikely to hold in many instances. Yet the LPM still may be the correct model or, perhaps, justiﬁed for practical reasons. A sequential least squares (SLS) estimation procedure is introduced that may outperform OLS in terms of ﬁnite sample bias and yields a consistent estimator. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that SLS outperforms OLS, probit and logit in terms of mean squared error of the predicted probabilities. An empirical example is provided.},

	shorttitle = {Logistic or {Linear}?},

	abstract = {When the outcome of interest is binary, psychologists often use nonlinear modeling strategies such as logit or probit. Whereas these strategies are necessary in the context of prediction, they are often neither optimal nor justiﬁed when the objective is to estimate causal eﬀects. Researchers need to take extra steps to convert logit and probit coeﬃcients into interpretable quantities, and when they do, these quantities often remain diﬃcult to understand. Odds ratios, for instance, are described as obscure in many textbooks (e.g., Gelman \& Hill, 2006, p. 83). In this paper, I draw on econometric theory and established statistical ﬁndings to demonstrate that linear regression (OLS) is generally the best strategy to estimate causal eﬀects on binary outcomes. First, linear regression is computationally simpler than nonlinear regression analysis. Second, OLS coeﬃcients are directly interpretable in terms of probabilities. Finally, when adjustments such as interaction terms or ﬁxed eﬀects are involved, linear regression is a safer choice. After discussing the relevant literature, I introduce the “Neyman-Rubin Causal Model", which I use to prove analytically that linear regression yields unbiased estimates of causal eﬀects, even when outcomes are binary. Then, I run simulations and analyze existing data on 24,191 students from 56 middle-schools (Paluck, Shepherd, \& Aronow, 2016) to illustrate the eﬀectiveness of linear regression with binary outcomes. Based on these grounds, I recommend that psychologists use linear regression instead of logit or probit models to estimate causal eﬀects on binary outcomes.},
